# Beluga

A tool for building and deploying docker web applications in CI without Kubernetes.

## Example Usage

In ideal an ideal situation you can set up the server with HTTP or HTTPS by using one of the `docker-compose.yaml` files below.

```yaml
version: "3.5"
services: # TODO
```

## Commands

### `beluga build`

Pulls the latest build, then uses it as a cache, to build and push a docker image to a registry.

### `beluga build [COMPOSE_FILE]`

Sends the `docker-compose.yaml` file to the belugad server, where it will be loaded.

### `beluga teardown`

Instructs belugad to teardown the stack deployed for a `beluga build` command.

### `belugad serve`

Starts the deamon to run with nginx-proxy and, optionally, nginx-proxy-companion. The only time you'll need to interact with this is to set it up.
